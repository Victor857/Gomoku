Gomoku

Gomoku is a board game where players alternate turns placing a
piece of their colour on an empty intersection of the board. Black
plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken
chain of five pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This is a web application of the gomoku game. A computer
